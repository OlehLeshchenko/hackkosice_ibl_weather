Here are some safety tips for dealing with a Tornado:


        *Stay Informed: Keep track of weather updates and warnings issued by local authorities. Have a reliable source of information such as a weather radio or smartphone app.

        *Identify Shelter: Identify the safest place to seek shelter during a tornado, such as a basement, storm cellar, or interior room on the lowest level of a sturdy building.

        *Create a Tornado Emergency Kit: Prepare a tornado emergency kit with essentials like water, non-perishable food, flashlight, batteries, first aid supplies, blankets, and a whistle.

        *Stay Away from Windows: Avoid windows and exterior walls during a tornado. Seek shelter in an interior room or hallway away from windows, doors, and outside walls.

        *Protect Your Head: If you can't find a shelter, protect your head and neck with your arms. If possible, cover yourself with a mattress or heavy blankets to shield against flying debris.

        *Listen for Alerts: Stay tuned to local news and weather updates for information on tornado watches and warnings. Heed evacuation orders or instructions to seek shelter immediately.

        *Avoid Mobile Homes: Mobile homes are particularly vulnerable to tornadoes. If you live in a mobile home, have a plan to seek shelter in a nearby sturdy building or designated storm shelter.

        *Stay Calm: Remain calm and reassure others, especially children and pets. Panic can impair decision-making and increase the risk of injury.

        *After the Tornado: Wait until authorities confirm that it's safe before leaving your shelter. Watch out for hazards such as downed power lines, debris, and structural damage when assessing the damage.
