Here are some tips for staying safe during icy conditions if you're driving:


        *Slow down: Slow down and drive at a safe speed appropriate for the road conditions. Ice reduces traction, increasing the likelihood of accidents.

        *Increase your following distance: Leave extra space between your vehicle and the one in front of you. This extra distance gives you more time to react in the event of a sudden stop or skid.

        *Avoid sudden maneuvers: Steer, brake, and accelerate as smoothly and gently as possible to avoid skidding. Sudden movements can cause you to lose control on icy roads.

        *Brake early and gradually: Start braking earlier than usual when approaching intersections, stops, or curves. Brake gently and gradually to avoid wheel lock-up and skidding.

        *Use lower gears: If you drive a manual transmission, use a lower gear to maintain control and reduce the risk of skidding on icy roads.

        *Beware of black ice: Black ice, a thin layer of clear ice that forms on the road surface, is particularly dangerous because it is difficult to see. Watch out for shaded areas, bridges, and overpasses where ice is most likely to form.

        *Pay attention to warning signs: Pay attention to warning signs indicating icy roads, such as road signs, weather forecasts, and local government notices. Consider postponing your trip if conditions are sky
