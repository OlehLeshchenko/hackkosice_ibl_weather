Fire Hazard Safety Tips:


        *Stay Informed: Keep up-to-date with the latest information about the fire hazard and any evacuation notices from local authorities.

        *Evacuate if Necessary: Follow evacuation orders promptly if you're in a fire-prone area. Don't delay leaving until the last minute.

        *Create Defensible Space: Clear dry leaves, debris, and flammable materials from around your home to create a defensible space, slowing the fire's spread.

        *Close Windows and Doors: Shut all windows and doors to prevent embers from entering your home. Use duct tape or towels to seal any gaps and limit smoke infiltration.

        *Pack Emergency Supplies: Prepare an emergency kit with essentials like water, non-perishable food, medications, important documents, and a flashlight.

        *Stay Low if Trapped: Stay close to the ground if unable to evacuate and smoke is present. Use wet towels to cover your nose and mouth for cleaner air.

        *Call for Help: If trapped, call emergency services immediately and provide your location. Signal for help by waving a flashlight or cloth out of a window.

        *Use Fire Extinguishers: If safe, use fire extinguishers to tackle small fires. Aim at the base of flames and sweep side to side.

        *Stay Calm: Keep calm and focused. Panicking can hinder your ability to make rational decisions.

        *Follow Authorities' Instructions: Obey instructions from firefighters and emergency responders. They're trained to guide you to safety.

Safety is paramount during a Fire Hazard. Take proactive steps to protect yourself and your loved ones.
